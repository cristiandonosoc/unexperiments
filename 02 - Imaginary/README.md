This game was an idea of using a point n' click type of game to explore the
reality of a depressed office worker in his depressing work, where
nothing motivates him. He is very frustrated and hates many aspects of his
life. That's way he escaped into his imagination in order to live the passions
that he cannot live in his day to day life. 

Sadly, due to time restraints, only part of the office could be implemented.
Nonetheless, I learned a lot about making art for a game, exploring pixel-art.
